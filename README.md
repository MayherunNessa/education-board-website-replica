# Education Board Bangladesh website replica

## Technologies used
Vanilla HTML and CSS

## About
It's one of the first fully responsive websites I've done. 
Others were deleted unfortunately by accident and couldn't recover them. 
I wasn't well versed in Git and Git Hub then so it is lost forever.

## Challenges faced
The main challenge was getting the font sizes right. It was a tough task for me as a beginner. 
But after playing around with it and tweaking it here and there, The font sizes finally looked similar to the original website.

The second challenge was getting the colors, especially the gradient to match with the original website.
Fortunately, it was easily solved by using a color picker to match. However, the gradient was still a tough nut to crack.
It took a while for me to set the proper gradient until I was satisfied.

Lastly, setting the overall layout and making it responsive using the flex-box method was quite difficult for me as I still had a hard time understanding it.
But, through this project, I was able to fully grasp its concepts.


## Conclution
This project was challenging but fun. I failed a lot but learned a lot too. 
I gained more knowledge on topics like CSS flex-box, relative units, CSS gradients, etc.

Happy coding!
